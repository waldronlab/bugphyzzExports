Importing 33 physiologies for propagation: aerophilicity, gram stain, biosafety level, COGEM pathogenicity rating, shape, spore shape, arrangement, hemolysis, habitat, disease association, antimicrobial resistance, plant pathogenicity, acetate producing, sphingolipid producing, lactate producing, butyrate producing, hydrogen gas producing, pathogenicity human, motility, biofilm forming, extreme environment, animal pathogen, antimicrobial sensitivity, spore formation, health associated, growth temperature, optimal ph, width, length, genome size, coding genes, mutation rate per site per generation, mutation rate per site per year. 

Searching for attributes of type range. They will be converted to type multistate-intersection based on thresholds. 

mutation rate per site per generation is of type range and we have a threshold for it. Converting mutation rate per site per generation to multistate-intersection. 
mutation rate per site per year is of type range and we have a threshold for it. Converting mutation rate per site per year to multistate-intersection. 
length is of type range and we have a threshold for it. Converting length to multistate-intersection. 
width is of type range and we have a threshold for it. Converting width to multistate-intersection. 
optimal ph is of type range and we have a threshold for it. Converting optimal ph to multistate-intersection. 
genome size is of type range and we have a threshold for it. Converting genome size to multistate-intersection. 
coding genes is of type range and we have a threshold for it. Converting coding genes to multistate-intersection. 
growth temperature is of type range and we have a threshold for it. Converting growth temperature to multistate-intersection. 
 

Check that all attributes are valid. Invalid values will not be exported. Invalid values can be checked on the log file. 

These values are not valid for disease association: caries, periodontal disorder, Infection caused by Escherichia coli (disorder), Endocarditis, Meningitis, Periodontal Disorder, tumors, Infection, arthritis, meningitis septicemia, septicemia arthritis, Fever, urlnary tract infection, Tetnus. 
These values are not valid for biosafety level: biosafety level 1+, biosafety level 3**, biosafety level L1. 
These values are not valid for shape: square, vibriod cell, rod-shaped, coccus-shaped, filament-shaped, ellipsoidal, pleomorphic-shaped, ovoid-shaped, oval-shaped, other, sphere-shaped, spiral-shaped, curved-shaped, helical-shaped, vibrio-shaped, ring-shaped, spore-shaped, crescent-shaped, star-shaped, diplococcus-shaped. 
These values are not valid for aerophilicity: facultative aerobe, microaerotolerant.
