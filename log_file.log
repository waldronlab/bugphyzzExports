Importing 4 physiologies for propagation: aerophilicity, habitat, plant pathogenicity, growth temperature. 

Searching for attributes of type range. They will be converted to type multistate-intersection based on thresholds. 

growth temperature is of type range and we have a threshold for it. Converting growth temperature to multistate-intersection.
